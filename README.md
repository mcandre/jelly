# jelly: the JSON build system

# SUMMARY

A basic build system cobbled together from the jq JSON utility and a handful of POSIX standard commands.

# EXAMPLE

```console
$ cd example

$ ./jelly | sh
Pass

$ ./jelly test | sh
Pass

$ ./jelly lint | sh
./bad.json
parse error: Expected another key-value pair at line 3, column 1

$ ./jelly help | sh
Usage: ./jelly <task> | sh

Tasks:

help
lint
test
```

# CONFIGURATION

The build system is configured with a jq script named `jelly` (no file extension). The file should feature `chmod +x` permissions.

## Shebang!

```console
#!/usr/bin/env jq -nrf --args
```

`#!` is the classic UNIX marker that signals the shell to apply a different interpreter to execute the rest of the script. `/usr/bin/env jq` informs the shell where to find the jq interpreter, whose absolute path will differ between operating systems.

The `-n` flag informs jq to not stall and expect instructions from stdin.

The `-r` flag informs jq to emit output in raw form, so that the shell commands it emits will not be wrapped in JSON document braces.

The `-f` flag informs jq to process the rest of the script as a series of jq instructions.

The `--args` flag informs jq to receive all successive command line arguments supplied (to `./jelly`) in the standard jq `$ARGS.positional` array variable.

## Create a task

jelly tasks are created with shell command strings, indexed by task name in a single JSON document.

A task may specify multiple shell commands through the conventional semicolon (`;`) shell command delimiter.

Note that additional quoting may be required for certain characters, according to traditional C-style backslash syntax.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env jq -nrf --args
{
    "test": "echo 'Pass'"
}
| .[($ARGS.positional[0] // "test")]

```

Here, we see an concise jelly build system with a single `test` task.

`// "test"` declares the `test` task as the default, when no task is named when jelly runs.

Naturally, you will want to replace uninformative `echo 'Pass'` commands with some real commands relevant to your specific testing needs.

### Dry Run

For debugging, temporarily drop `| sh` to see a dry run of the commands that jelly would have executed.

## Further Research

A looping mechanism would add support for processing multiple targets in a single `./jelly <task> <task> <task>`... invocation.

GNU `head` features support for `-n` with negative values, removing the need for inefficient `tail -r` file content reversal.

A shell function shadowing `jelly` would alleviate the need to manually append `| sh` to each run. One day, jq may even implement a syntax for executing shell commands on its own.

Much JSON related work will be simplified when the format officially adopts a comment syntax, preferably one that integrates well with UNIX shebangs.
